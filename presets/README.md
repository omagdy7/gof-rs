# CREDITS
  The largest single source for the early versions of this lexicon was
a glossary compiled by Alan Hensel "with indispensable help from John
Conway, Dean Hickerson, David Bell, Bill Gosper, Bob Wainwright, Noam
Elkies, Nathan Thompson, Harold McIntosh, and Dan Hoey".
  Other sources include the works listed in the bibliography at the
end of this lexicon, as well as pattern collections by Alan Hensel and
David Bell (and especially Dean Hickerson's file stamp.l in the latter
collection), and the web sites of Mark Niemiec, Paul Callahan, Achim
Flammenkamp, Robert Wainwright and Heinrich Koenig.  Recent releases
also use a lot of information from Dean Hickerson's header to his
1995 stamp file (http://conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/stamps.html).
  Most of the information on recent results is from the discoverers
themselves, or from Nathaniel Johnston's excellent resources at
http://www.conwaylife.com, including both the LifeWiki and the
discussion forums.
  The following people all provided useful comments on earlier releases
of this lexicon:  David Bell, Nicolay Beluchenko, Johan Bontes, Daniel
Collazo, Scot Ellison, Nick Gotts, Ivan Fomichev, Dave Greene, Alan
Hensel, Dean Hickerson, Dieter Leithner, Mark Niemiec, Gabriel Nivasch,
Andrzej Okrasinski, Arie Paap, Peter Rott, Chris Rowett, Tony Smith,
Ken Takusagawa, Andrew Trevorrow, Malcolm Tyrrell, and the
conwaylife.com forum users with the handles 'thunk' and 'Apple Bottom'.
  The format, errors, use of British English and anything else you
might want to complain about are by Stephen Silver - except that for
post-Version 25 definitions, everything besides the British English
may well be Dave Greene's fault instead.
